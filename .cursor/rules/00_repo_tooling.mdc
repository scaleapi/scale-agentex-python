Use Rye for Python dependency management and workflows. Prefer these commands:

- Setup env: `./scripts/bootstrap` or `rye sync --all-features` [[Use Rye in this repo]]
- Run tests: `rye run pytest` or `./scripts/test`
- Run a specific test: `rye run pytest path/to/test_file.py::TestClass::test_method -v`
- Format: `rye run format` or `./scripts/format`
- Lint: `rye run lint` or `./scripts/lint`
- Type check: `rye run typecheck` (runs pyright and mypy)
- Build: `rye build`

Environment requirements:

- Python 3.12+ is required
- A mock server auto-starts for tests on port 4010

Notes:

- Only use `uv` inside of tutorial folders which have their own virtualenv (managed by a tutorial specific pyproject.toml inside the relevant tutorial folder). Otherwise use rye at the top level.
