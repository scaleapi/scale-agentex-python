When invoking external tools or the terminal, follow these constraints:

- Web search is allowed when needed for docs and references
- Prefer fetching docs from `docs.temporal.io` when researching Temporal topics
- Allowed bash commands should go through Rye workflows:
  - `rye run pytest:*`
  - `rye run lint:*`
  - `rye run typecheck:*`
  - `rye run sync:*`
  - `rye run build:*`

Default to Rye; only use other tools when explicitly required by the codebase.
