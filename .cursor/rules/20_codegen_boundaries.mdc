description: Keep manual code separate from generated SDK code
globs: "src/agentex/**"

Guideline:

- Avoid modifying auto-generated files in `src/agentex/` except where explicitly intended. Place custom logic, extensions, and higher-level abstractions in `src/agentex/lib/`.
- When adding features, prefer adding new modules under `src/agentex/lib/**` rather than changing generated files directly.
- If a change to generated code is required, document the reason and ensure the generator configuration or upstream schema is updated to make the change reproducible.
