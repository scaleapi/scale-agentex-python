Temporal integration:

- Workflow definitions live in `lib/core/temporal/`
- Include activity definitions for different providers and worker implementations
- Keep workflow logic deterministic and side-effect free; move I/O into activities

Agent framework:

- Agents are manifest-driven and support multiple agent types (sync and Temporal-based)
- Use the examples under `examples/10_agentic/` and `examples/10_temporal/` for patterns
- For debugging agents, use the CLI flags `--debug-worker` and `--debug-port`
