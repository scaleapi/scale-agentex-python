Testing:

- Run tests with `rye run pytest` or `./scripts/test`
- To run a specific test: `rye run pytest path/to/test_file.py::TestClass::test_method -v`
- A mock server is automatically started for tests on port 4010

When writing tests:

- Prefer deterministic unit tests that do not depend on external services
- Use the mock server and fixtures provided in the repository
