Standards:

- Format code via `rye run format` or `./scripts/format`
- Lint via `rye run lint` or `./scripts/lint`
- Type check via `rye run typecheck` (pyright + mypy)

Guidance:

- Keep code readable and consistent; prefer small, focused functions
- Avoid introducing style or type violations; fix before committing
