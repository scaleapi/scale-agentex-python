Tests for s020-streaming (sync agent with state management)

This test suite validates:
- Non-streaming message sending with state tracking
- Streaming message sending with state tracking
- Message history validation
- State persistence across turns

Prerequisites:
    - AgentEx services running (make dev)
    - Agent running: agentex agents run --manifest manifest.yaml

Run: pytest tests/test_agent.py -v
