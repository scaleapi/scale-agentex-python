"""
Sample tests for AgentEx ACP agent.

This test suite demonstrates how to test the main AgentEx API functions:
- Non-streaming event sending and polling
- Streaming event sending

To run these tests:
1. Make sure the agent is running (via docker-compose or `agentex agents run`)
2. Set the AGENTEX_API_BASE_URL environment variable if not using default
3. Run: pytest test_agent.py -v

Configuration:
- AGENTEX_API_BASE_URL: Base URL for the AgentEx server (default: http://localhost:5003)
- AGENT_NAME: Name of the agent to test (default: ab080-batch-events)
