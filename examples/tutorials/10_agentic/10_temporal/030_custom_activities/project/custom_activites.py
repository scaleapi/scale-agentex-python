    This activity will take a list of events and process them.
    
    This is a simple example that demonstrates how to:
    1. Create a custom Temporal activity
    2. Accept structured parameters via Pydantic models
    3. Process batched data
    4. Simulate work with async sleep
    5. Return results back to the workflow
    
    In a real-world scenario, you could:
    - Make database calls (batch inserts, updates)
    - Call external APIs (payment processing, email sending)
    - Perform heavy computations (ML model inference, data analysis)
    - Generate reports or files
    - Any other business logic that benefits from Temporal's reliability
    
    The key benefit is that this activity will automatically:
    - Retry on failures (with configurable retry policies)
    - Be durable across worker restarts
    - Provide observability and metrics
    - Handle timeouts and cancellations gracefully
