OpenAI Agents SDK + Temporal Integration: Human-in-the-Loop Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to pause agent execution and wait for human approval
using Temporal's child workflows and signals.

KEY CONCEPTS:
- Child workflows: Independent workflows spawned by parent for human interaction
- Signals: External systems can send messages to running workflows
- Durable waiting: Agents can wait indefinitely for human input without losing state

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Without Temporal, if your system crashes while waiting for human approval, you lose
all context. With Temporal, the agent resumes exactly where it left off after
system failures, making human-in-the-loop workflows production-ready.

PATTERN:
1. Agent calls wait_for_confirmation tool
2. Tool spawns child workflow that waits for signal
3. Human approves via CLI/web app
4. Child workflow completes, agent continues

Usage: `temporal workflow signal --workflow-id="child-workflow-id" --name="fulfill_order_signal" --input=true`
