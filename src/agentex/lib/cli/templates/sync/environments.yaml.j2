# Agent Environment Configuration
# ------------------------------
# This file defines environment-specific settings for your agent.
# This DIFFERS from the manifest.yaml file in that it is used to program things that are ONLY per environment.

# ********** EXAMPLE **********
# schema_version: "v1" # This is used to validate the file structure and is not used by the agentex CLI
# environments:
#   dev:
#     auth:
#       principal:
#         user_id: "1234567890"
#         user_name: "John Doe"
#         user_email: "john.doe@example.com"
#         user_role: "admin"
#       user_permissions: "read, write, delete"
#     helm_overrides: # This is used to override the global helm values.yaml file in the agentex-agent helm charts
#       replicas: 3
#       resources:
#         requests:
#           cpu: "1000m"
#           memory: "2Gi"
#         limits:
#           cpu: "2000m"
#           memory: "4Gi"
#       env:
#         - name: LOG_LEVEL
#           value: "DEBUG"
#         - name: ENVIRONMENT
#           value: "staging"
#     kubernetes: 
#       # OPTIONAL - Otherwise it will be derived from separately. However, this can be used to override the derived
#       #   namespace and deploy it with in the same namespace that already exists for a separate agent.
#       namespace: "team-{{agent_name}}"
