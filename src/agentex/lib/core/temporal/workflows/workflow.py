        True when Temporal suggests it: ``is_continue_as_new_suggested()`` fires as
        the event history approaches the server's size/count limit, so we let
        Temporal own the threshold rather than configuring one ourselves.

        This reads only a deterministic ``workflow.info()`` value and emits no
        commands, so it is safe to use directly as a ``workflow.wait_condition``
        predicate, e.g.::

            await workflow.wait_condition(

        Call this from the agent's ``@workflow.run`` once the run loop wakes for a
        recycle (see :meth:`should_continue_as_new`). ``args`` are forwarded
        verbatim to ``workflow.continue_as_new`` and become the new run's input, so
        pass whatever your ``@workflow.run`` signature expects — typically the
        original ``CreateTaskParams`` (the new run keeps the same workflow id / task
        id and re-hydrates its state from ``adk.state``).

        IMPORTANT: keep your data OUTSIDE workflow state BEFORE calling this —
        messages in ``adk.messages`` and any other state in ``adk.state``.
        In-workflow attributes do NOT survive the recycle; only the forwarded

        this never returns normally — EXCEPT when ``is_complete`` is given and
        returns True after draining: a completion signal can arrive while we wait
        for the drain, and the recycled run would start fresh (losing that
        completion), so in that case we return without recycling and let the caller

        continue-as-new on recycle (typically the original ``CreateTaskParams``).

        Adopting this method IS the opt-in to recycling — there is no flag. An agent
        that keeps the old indefinite ``wait_condition`` never recycles.

        ``timeout`` is an optional cap on how long to wait with no progress; it
        defaults to None = wait indefinitely (the usual case — Temporal can keep huge
        numbers of idle workflows open). The broader workflow-level lifetime cap is
        the execution timeout (``WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``, also infinite
        by default). On ``timeout`` expiry ``wait_condition`` raises
        ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` like before.

        agent pod over HTTP JSON-RPC; the ACP/Temporal layer routes it to the
